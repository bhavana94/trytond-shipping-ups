Tryton Shipping Integration with UPS
=====================================

This documentation illustrates how shipment carrier costs via UPS can
be calculated. It also explains how to generate shipping labels.

If UPS is offered as a shipping option, customers can check UPS
shipping rates at checkout, for delivery to their selected address.
To provide this service, register for a UPS Account, where License Key and
Shipper Number will be generated. After this, UPS can be activated within 
tryton module. 

The documentation assumes that an account on UPS has been created and the user
has the following information:

* UPS License Key
* UPS User Password
* UPS Shipper Number
* UPS User ID

Once all these details have been configured out, customers can select the UPS
Shipping rates during checkout. The UPS Shipping Labels can also be generated.
